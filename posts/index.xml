      <description>Back with the RPis Last time I was playing with the Raspberry Pi I used ansible to configure docker and some services on it. I still wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy with the solution: my RPi 2 was really slow to run the Ansible configuration and the setup couldn&amp;rsquo;t really recover from any errors without manual intervention.</description>

      <description>Tired of configuring my RBP I&amp;rsquo;ve had a raspberry pi for a while and most of the time it rests off in a drawer. From time to time I dust off the SD card to setup the box with dynamic DNS and play with it as my personal server.</description>
