I'm easily intrigued to learn stuff. I started off as Java developer and migrated to SRE. Go has a special place in my heart for being strongly type, easy to compile and deploy all architectures I've ever used. Currently I help think, implement and manage the use of cloud infrastructure and pipelines in [QuintoAndar](https://quintoandar.com.br).
